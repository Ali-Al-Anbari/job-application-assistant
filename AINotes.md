# AI-Assisted Development Notes

## Chrome Extension Setup

### Task
Turn the React + Vite project into a basic Chrome extension.

### What I asked AI
I asked Copilot to plan the smallest way to make the React app open as a Chrome extension popup.

I told it not to add:
- extra permissions
- background scripts
- content scripts
- new dependencies

### What AI suggested
Copilot suggested adding only:

`public/manifest.json`

### What I accepted
I accepted the simple approach.

### What I changed or rejected
Nothing needed to be changed.

### Testing
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- Loaded the `dist` folder in Chrome
- Confirmed the React app opened correctly

---

## Popup + Dashboard Setup

### Task
Create separate popup and dashboard pages.

### AI Usage
Copilot helped plan and create the two-page Vite setup.

### Decision
Used separate `index.html` and `dashboard.html` pages instead of React Router.

### Why
The popup and dashboard are separate interfaces, so routing was unnecessary.

### Testing
- Ran `npm run lint`
- Ran `npm run build`
- Confirmed both pages were generated
- Confirmed the popup worked in Chrome
- Confirmed the dashboard worked in Chrome
